## 5448. Path Crossing

Given a string `path`, where `path[i] = 'N'`, `'S'`, `'E'` or `'W'`, each representing moving one unit north, south, east, or west, respectively. You start at the origin `(0, 0)` on a 2D plane and walk on the path specified by `path`.

Return `True` if the path crosses itself at any point, that is, if at any time you are on a location you've previously visited. Return `False` otherwise.

**Example 1:**

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SaberDa/LeetCode/master/contest/contest195/pic/ex1.png)

```
Input: path = "NES"
Output: false 
Explanation: Notice that the path doesn't cross any point more than once.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SaberDa/LeetCode/master/contest/contest195/pic/ex2.png)

```
Input: path = "NESWW"
Output: true
Explanation: Notice that the path visits the origin twice.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= path.length <= 10^4`
- `path` will only consist of characters in `{'N', 'S', 'E', 'W}`

## 5449. Check If Array Pairs Are Divisible by k

Given an array of integers `arr` of even length `n` and an integer `k`.

We want to divide the array into exactly `n / 2` pairs such that the sum of each pair is divisible by `k`.

Return *True* If you can find a way to do that or *False* otherwise.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: arr = [1,2,3,4,5,10,6,7,8,9], k = 5
Output: true
Explanation: Pairs are (1,9),(2,8),(3,7),(4,6) and (5,10).
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6], k = 7
Output: true
Explanation: Pairs are (1,6),(2,5) and(3,4).
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6], k = 10
Output: false
Explanation: You can try all possible pairs to see that there is no way to divide arr into 3 pairs each with sum divisible by 10.
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: arr = [-10,10], k = 2
Output: true
```

**Example 5:**

```
Input: arr = [-1,1,-2,2,-3,3,-4,4], k = 3
Output: true
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `arr.length == n`
- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `n` is even.
- `-10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9`
- `1 <= k <= 10^5`

## 5450. Number of Subsequences That Satisfy the Given Sum Condition

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`.

Return the number of **non-empty** subsequences of `nums` such that the sum of the minimum and maximum element on it is less or equal than `target`.

Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [3,5,6,7], target = 9
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 subsequences that satisfy the condition.
[3] -> Min value + max value <= target (3 + 3 <= 9)
[3,5] -> (3 + 5 <= 9)
[3,5,6] -> (3 + 6 <= 9)
[3,6] -> (3 + 6 <= 9)
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [3,3,6,8], target = 10
Output: 6
Explanation: There are 6 subsequences that satisfy the condition. (nums can have repeated numbers).
[3] , [3] , [3,3], [3,6] , [3,6] , [3,3,6]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [2,3,3,4,6,7], target = 12
Output: 61
Explanation: There are 63 non-empty subsequences, two of them don't satisfy the condition ([6,7], [7]).
Number of valid subsequences (63 - 2 = 61).
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: nums = [5,2,4,1,7,6,8], target = 16
Output: 127
Explanation: All non-empty subset satisfy the condition (2^7 - 1) = 127
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^6`
- `1 <= target <= 10^6`

##  5451. Max Value of Equation

Given an array `points` containing the coordinates of points on a 2D plane, sorted by the x-values, where `points[i] = [xi, yi]` such that `xi < xj` for all `1 <= i < j <= points.length`. You are also given an integer `k`.

Find the *maximum value of the equation* `yi + yj + |xi - xj|` where `|xi - xj| <= k` and `1 <= i < j <= points.length`. It is guaranteed that there exists at least one pair of points that satisfy the constraint `|xi - xj| <= k`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: points = [[1,3],[2,0],[5,10],[6,-10]], k = 1
Output: 4
Explanation: The first two points satisfy the condition |xi - xj| <= 1 and if we calculate the equation we get 3 + 0 + |1 - 2| = 4. Third and fourth points also satisfy the condition and give a value of 10 + -10 + |5 - 6| = 1.
No other pairs satisfy the condition, so we return the max of 4 and 1.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: points = [[0,0],[3,0],[9,2]], k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: Only the first two points have an absolute difference of 3 or less in the x-values, and give the value of 0 + 0 + |0 - 3| = 3.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= points.length <= 10^5`
- `points[i].length == 2`
- `-10^8 <= points[i][0], points[i][1] <= 10^8`
- `0 <= k <= 2 * 10^8`
- `points[i][0] < points[j][0]` for all `1 <= i < j <= points.length`
- `xi` form a strictly increasing sequence.
